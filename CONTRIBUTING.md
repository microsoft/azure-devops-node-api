# Building the Code

## Pre-requisites

To build and test you need LTS Node >= 6.12.0 and Npm 5.5.1 (we use lock files).  You can download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Test

You should test with node 6.x, 10.x and 16.x LTS.  We recommend using nvm ([linux](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) / [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

To run units:

```sh
npm run units
```

To run all tests:

```sh
npm test
```

# How to contribute

One of the best ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and request features you need. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussion

Start or join into a discussion on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-node-api/issues).

## Bugs feature requests

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-node-api/issues/new).

## General contribution guide

> Keep in mind: most of the code in this repository is auto-generated, but you can contribute to the non-generated aspects of the library.

1. Unless it is a trivial change, make sure that there is a corresponding issue for your change first. If there is none, create one.
2. Create a fork in GitHub
3. Create a branch off the `master` branch. Name it something that makes sense, such as `issue-123` or `githubhandle-issue`. This makes it easy for everyone to figure out what the branch is used for. It also makes it easier to isolate your change from incoming changes from the origin.
4. Commit your changes and push your changes to GitHub
5. Create a pull request against the origin's `master` branch. [Learn more about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap.

You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.

### Generated Code

Most of library is auto-generated and we will usually not accept pull requests on these files, but you can contribute to the non-generated aspects of the library. Right now, that includes:

* ./Api/VsoClient.ts
* ./Api/WebApi.ts
* ./Api/Interfaces/common/VsoBaseInterfaces.ts
* ./Api/handlers/*
* anything outside of ./Api

### Commits

Please format commit messages as follows (based on this [excellent post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):

```text
Summarize change in 50 characters or less

Provide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the
summary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.

If the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final
paragraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format
below.

Fix #42
```

Also do your best to factor commits appropriately, i.e not too large with unrelated
things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small change applied N
times in N different commits. If there was some accidental reformatting or whitespace
changes during the course of your commits, please rebase them away before submitting
the PR.

# Instructions for Logging Issues

## 1. Search for Duplicates

[Search the existing issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-node-api/issues) before logging a new one.

## 2. Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:

* What version are you using?
* If at all possible, an *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior
* The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior
* Ensure it doesn't reproduce on the latest version or master
* An http trace from fiddler or charles if possible (the relevant parts)

## 3. Do you have a suggestion?

We also accept suggestions in the issue tracker.

In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:

* A description of the problem you're trying to solve
* An overview of the suggested solution
* Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places
  * Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn't"
  * Code examples showing the generated JavaScript (if applicable)
* If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior
